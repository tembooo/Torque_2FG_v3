# Paert Two: investigating the features. 

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Analysis

Below is a sample visualization of torque vs input features: (current is F9)

Based on the picture we cas see that Current has an impact on all of the features as well.

# Paert one: Torque_2FG_v3

This repository contains data and resources for building a predictive model of **torque** based on electrical machine parameters.  
The project is based on datasets provided by **Arash** and aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for accurate torque estimation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict torque** in a two-phase generator (2FG) system using machine learning models trained on the provided datasets.  
By leveraging the relationship between `Ld`, `Lq`, and torque, we aim to create a robust model that can be used for analysis, optimization, and control purposes.
